    <h1>SWOT analysis</h1>
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p>
        My strengths lie in my programming skills and my abillity to solve problems.
        I am able to to pick up new skills and learn new techniques quickly.
        As I studied Allgemeine Informatik at the HFU I started to get interested in game deveolpment which is
        inherently intertwined with the field of interaction design.
        A prototyp of a game I created recently (as part of the course PRIMA held by Professor Jirka DellÂ´Oro-Friedl, created with <a href="https://github.com/JirkaDellOro/FUDGE">FUDGE</a>)
        can be played <a href="https://plojo.github.io/PRIMA/Tower/index.html">here</a> (use W A S D, Space and ESC to
        controll. F11 for fullscreen. Can only be played on desktop. Works in Chrome).</p>
    <h2>Weakness</h2>
    <p>
        My shortcomings in the context of this course are probably that while I did had courses focused on
        creating UIs, these courses didn't really focus on design principles and psychological aspects of interaction
        design but rather just on devolpment/implementation, which is why im lacking in these areas.</p>
    <h2>Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
        I hope I can improve my skills in the underlying design principles of interaction design. Im
        espacially interested in the psychological aspects of interaction design.</p>
    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>
        The main concern for me is my lacking prior knowledge in this field. Most likely I will have to spend some extra
        time on researching. Im also not particularly fond of distance learning.</p>
